But his winning streak came to a screeching halt this year with the gallingly unfunny Playing With Fire, directed by the guy who made the second Paul Blart. Surprisingly dark (no one thought to push this movie’s release date back to a time when there wasn’t a raging wildfire destroying California?) while also exhaustingly reliant on jokes about poop, the movie gets an exceedingly stiff performance out of Cena, though everyone on screen mostly just looks embarrassed.
