Oh my is this film terrible. I really wanted to like this film, honest; in fact, I bought it before actually seeing it. Seriously though, this film is grossly pregnant; there is nothing there; itâ€™s fluff; get it? Forgebodit!! Boxing movies are stupid enough as is, next to football flicks of course.
