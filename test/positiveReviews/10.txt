Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez broke new ground in cinematic storytelling with this ultra-violent, irresistibly cool anthology of brutal crime and sweet revenge. Some of the stories are more interesting than others, but as a whole the movie is all kinds of awesome, with Bruce Willis in one of his best hero roles ever alongside John McClane and Butch the Boxer.
