Based on a novella by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is a harrowing tale about the triumph of the human spirit. The story follows a banker named Andy Duphrane who's wrongfully convicted of killing his wife and her lover, and is sent to the Shawshank maximum security prison where he befriends another inmate named Red. Starring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, John Sandler, and Clancy Brown, the film has an impressive cast that gives good performances. Additionally, screenwriter/director Frank Darabont does an excellent job at developing the characters and relationships; making the audience care about them and their plight. The set and costume designs too, are especially well-done; capturing the time-period and giving the prison a real, lived-in feel. Also, the score by Thomas Newman is emotionally evocative and has a soulfulness to it that heightens the material. The Shawshank Redemption is a remarkably compelling film with a powerful message.
