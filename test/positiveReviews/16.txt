One of Hollywood's great "dumb epics". It's absurd, melodramatic, filled with anachronisms and cartoonish characters . . . and yet, it's also highly re-watchable. I don't really know why, but I'm always completely invested in this goofy love story (especially when the boat starts to sink, which still has some of the most thrilling sequences in cinema history). You don't have to like the movie, but I sincerely doubt that people hate it as much as they say they do.
