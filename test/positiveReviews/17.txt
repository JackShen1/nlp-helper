I am sad that I am just now catching up on these iconic films. The Fellowship of the Ring is a sprawling, epic and hugely ambitious film, both technically masterful and narratively gripping. It's visual splendor is pure ahead of its time magic. This film is so beautiful to behold that even in 2017, it would have blown people away. What weighs it down somewhat is its excessive length that adds several battering fight scenes, that sometimes border on tedium. But the spectacular grandiosity of it all invokes a feeling of nostalgia and awe at the fantasy elements and characters. A truly exciting start to the series.
