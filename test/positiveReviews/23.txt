Frightening and full of suspense, Life is a terrifying sci-fi thriller. The story follows the crew of the International Space Station as they study specimens brought back by a Mars probe and discover a micro-organism; however the organism begins to rapidly grow and starts attacking the station's crew. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Ryan Reynolds, the film has an impressive cast that delivers some strong performances. And the special effects are especially good, particularly the creature deigns; which starts out rather innocent looking and gets progressively sinister and menacing as it grows. The score is also incredibly well-done; capturing the dark and foreboding tone of the material. Yet the plot is rather predictable and somewhat derivative of other sci-fi films. Still, Life is intense and entertaining, and delivers some chilling scares.
