I've had my fill of the undead, but between vampires and zombies, zombies are far less interesting. At least vamps can have personality - zombies don't do anything except groan and try to eat you. Therefore it's up to the living to add interest. <i>World War Z</i> doesn't come remotely close to matching Zack Snyder's colorful cast of survivors in the premier zombie pic <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>, but Brad Pitt's charisma gives the film enough to fill in the brief spaces between action scenes. Given the lack of an original story, the breathless pace ultimately threatens to turn into an experience as mindless as the infected masses when the movie wisely reduces the adrenaline, yet ramps the tension through the roof during an outstanding lengthy nail-biting sequence at a World Health Org facility. Overall a superior, exciting zombie actioner with plenty of successful jump-scares, an impressive feat.
