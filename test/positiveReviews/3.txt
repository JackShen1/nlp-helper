Solid, well-made horror movie works because it covers all the necessary bases. First, the story is based on a bestselling Steven King novel about an evil clown who appears in sewers and other dark places. He represents trauma or pain, or perhaps exploits it, and targets children in a small Maine town. The acting is good, especially Skarsgard as Pennywise the "dancing clown." He's sinister, but in an effectively twisted way. Character depth is excellent too, and we care about what happens to these kids because of what they are going through, at home and together. The special effects and makeup are very good, and many scenes are scary AND fun. It is a long film, but it takes its time to create relationships between characters and subplots involving abusive parents, and town bullies. Overall, this is a fine, well-made horror movie that isn't necessarily the scariest movie ever, but it's creepy and fun, like a carnival dark ride.
